This is a Pokédex application created with React Native for both Android and IOS devices. Users can search for a Pokémon and Type and the application will fetch data for that Pokémon/Type from PokéAPI. After the data has been loaded the application will display the name of the Pokémon, its Pokédex number, its type and an image of that Pokémon. The application will calculate which types the Pokémon is strong against, weak against, resistant to and vulnerable to and display them conveniently. Alternatively by clicking the different types users can view information about that specific type fast and easily.
